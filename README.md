# Servo-for-Atmega328p

Simple library to control up to 12 servos on Atmega328p microcontroller. </br> </br>
The library uses Arduino UNO's pinout just for convenience as many of the popular development boards tend to use the same pinout for compatibility with Arduino shields. </br></br>
For reference documentation check the [library's wiki](https://github.com/Tai-Min/Servo-for-Atmega328p/wiki)
