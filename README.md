# Servo-for-Atmega328p

Simple library to control up to 12 servos on Atmega328p microcontroller. </br> </br>
The library uses Arduino UNO's pinout as many of the popular development boards tend to use the same pinout for compatibility with Arduino shields. </br>
This library, just like original Arduino's Servo.h library, disables PWM on pins 9 and 10,
